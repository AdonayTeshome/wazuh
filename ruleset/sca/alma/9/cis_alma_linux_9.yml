  # 1.1.1.1 Ensure mounting of squashfs filesystems is disabled. (Automated)

  - id: 31000
    title: "Ensure mounting of squashfs filesystems is disabled."
    description: "The squashfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems. A squashfs image can be used without having to first decompress the image."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    impact: 'As Snap packages utilizes squashfs as a compressed filesystem, disabling squashfs will cause Snap packages to fail. Snap application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software''s end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.'

  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition. (Automated)

  - id: 31002
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 tmpfs /tmp 0 Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment. <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection from exploitation An example of exploiting /var/tmp may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

  # 1.1.7.1 Ensure separate partition exists for /home. (Automated)

  - id: 31021
    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /home."
    description: "The /home directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /home on a separate partition is as follows. Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /home directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /home and impact all local users. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /home as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of /home options such as usrquota/grpquota may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection of user data As /home contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /home. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

  - id: 31024
    title: "Ensure /dev/shm is a separate partition."
    description: "The /dev/shm directory is a world-writable directory that can function as shared memory that facilitates inter process communication (IPC)."
    rationale: "Making /dev/shm its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /dev/shm useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by mounting tmpfs to /dev/shm."
    impact: "Since the /dev/shm directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. /dev/shm utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "For specific configuration requirements of the /dev/shm mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /dev/shm defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0 tmpfs."

    rationale: "Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. Attackers may replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs. Audit tools should be cryptographically signed in order to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files."

    description: "GNOME Desktop Manager can make the screen lock automatically whenever the user is idle for some amount of time. - idle-delay=uint32 {n} - Number of seconds of inactivity before the screen goes blank - lock-delay=uint32 {n} - Number of seconds after the screen is blank before locking the screen Example key file: # Specify the dconf path [org/gnome/desktop/session] # Number of seconds of inactivity before the screen goes blank # Set to 0 seconds if you want to deactivate the screensaver. idle-delay=uint32 900 # Specify the dconf path [org/gnome/desktop/screensaver] # Number of seconds after the screen is blank before locking the screen lock-delay=uint32 5."
    rationale: "Setting a lock-out value reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized user access to another user's session that has been left unattended."
    remediation: "Create or edit a file in the /etc/dconf/profile/ and verify it includes the following: user-db:user system-db:{NAME_OF_DCONF_DATABASE} Note: local is the name of a dconf database used in the examples. Example: # echo -e '\\nuser-db:user\\nsystem-db:local' >> /etc/dconf/profile/user Create the directory /etc/dconf/db/{NAME_OF_DCONF_DATABASE}.d/ if it doesn't already exist: Example: # mkdir /etc/dconf/db/local.d Create the key file `/etc/dconf/db/{NAME_OF_DCONF_DATABASE}.d/{FILE_NAME} to provide information for the {NAME_OF_DCONF_DATABASE} database: Example script: #!/usr/bin/env bash { l_key_file=\"/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver\" l_idmv=\"900\" # Set max value for idle-delay in seconds (between 1 and 900) l_ldmv=\"5\" # Set max value for lock-delay in seconds (between 0 and 5) { echo '# Specify the dconf path' echo '[org/gnome/desktop/session]' echo '' echo '# Number of seconds of inactivity before the screen goes blank' echo '# Set to 0 seconds if you want to deactivate the screensaver.' echo \"idle-delay=uint32 $l_idmv\" echo '' echo '# Specify the dconf path' echo '[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]' echo '' echo '# Number of seconds after the screen is blank before locking the screen' echo \"lock-delay=uint32 $l_ldmv\" } > \"$l_key_file\" } Note: You must include the uint32 along with the integer key values as shown. Run the following command to update the system databases: # dconf update Note: Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect."

    title: "Ensure GDM automatic mounting of removable media is disabled."
    description: "By default GNOME automatically mounts removable media when inserted as a convenience to the user."
    rationale: "With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it themselves."
    impact: "The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting."
    remediation: "Run the following script to disable automatic mounting of media for all GNOME users: #!/usr/bin/env bash { l_pkgoutput=\"\" l_gpname=\"local\" # Set to desired dconf profile name (default is local) # Check if GNOME Desktop Manager is installed.
