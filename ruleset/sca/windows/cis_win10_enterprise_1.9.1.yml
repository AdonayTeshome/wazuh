  # 1.1 Password Policy
  - id: 26000
    title: "Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)'"
    description: "This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password.The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s)."
    rationale: "The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced.If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 24 or more password(s):Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Account Policies/Password Policy/Enforce password history"

    title: "Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '60 or fewer days, but not 0'"
    description: "This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire.Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.The recommended state for this setting is 60 or fewer days, but not 0."
    rationale: "The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has authorized access."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 60 or fewer days, but not 0: Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Account Policies/Password Policy/Maximum password age"

  - id: 26002
    title: "Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)'"
    description: "This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value for this setting is 0 days.The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s))"
    rationale: "Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective."

    title: "Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)'"
    description: "This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps 'passphrase' is a better term than 'password.' In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as 'I want to drink a $5 milkshake' is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s)."
    rationale: "Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words 'and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). 'Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to 'discover the accounts and passwords"

    description: "This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords."
